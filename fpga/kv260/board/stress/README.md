# The two-core stress (board track, 2026-10-17)

The coordinator asked for it while soc-2's 100 MHz package waits: a long run on sc2 (two `smt2` cores, 70 MHz) under Debian 13, ahead of M8's 72-hour stress.

**The guest's loop** ([`stress.sh`](stress.sh); copied into the Debian image's `~/stress`). Each pass checks every result against x86's (the 5950X, the same sources and flags):
- **`gcc -O2` builds [`t.c`](t.c) and runs it:** it must print `5007905533300608`.
- **[`mt.c`](mt.c):** two threads on one cache line, 4,000,000 atomic adds and 400,000 mutex-held adds. It must print `mt ok 4000000 400000`. The line moves between the two cores' caches on every access.
- **A 9-file project ([`proj/`](proj/)):** compiled two files at a time (`xargs -P 2`, as `make -j2` would; `make` is not in the image) and linked. It must print `135808003256614222`.
- **`sysbench`:** cpu, memory and threads on two threads, 30 s each.
- **Kernel messages:** new lines that mean trouble (oops, BUG, panic, RCU stalls, lockups, hung tasks) fail the pass.

One line per pass: `STRESS pass N ok=… fails=… …`. Typing `q` on the console stops the loop after the current pass.

**The host side:**
- [`../runs/sc2_stress.sh`](../runs/sc2_stress.sh) boots it with no network.
- [`../runs/stress_monitor.sh`](../runs/stress_monitor.sh) logs, every 30 min, the last pass, the failure counts, the L2 error events, the injector and the fan.
- A watcher on the laptop stops the run (with `q`) when the 100 MHz package appears.

**Run s1** stopped after pass 1, which found that `make` is not installed (`ERR 127`); the `t` and `mt` results were right. Fixed with `xargs -P 2`.

**Run s2** started 17:37 (board time). Passes 1–2 were clean: 146–147 s each; sysbench cpu 53.8 events/s, memory 67.2 MiB/s, threads about 1,035 events.
